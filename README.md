Made a game with a randomly generated 2d hexagonal map. The core design includes a BFS safety check to guarantee the player always spawns in a large, open area (at least 100 tiles) and never gets trapped in a corner. You explore the map by moving only on grass tiles. The rock tiles are unwalkable and the script makes sure our player has a path to the clickable tile. using bfs.
